Create chat rooms on your site for users to participate in.

== Description ==

The Chat Room plugin allows administrators to easily create chat rooms for their users to participate in. Chat rooms are created via the WordPress administrative interface. After creation, users can access it via the permalink for the chat room.

The plugin currently will only support servers that have direct PHP filesystem access, which may not be available on all hosting environments.

All official development on this plugin is on GitHub. Version bumps will still be published here on WordPress.org. You can find the repo at [https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Chat-Room](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Chat-Room). Please file issues, bugs, and enhancement ideas there, when possible.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `chat-room` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create chat rooms via newly added menu item.
